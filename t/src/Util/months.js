    Memory:'Our first month dating began on August 14th, when we weren’t even sure where things would go. But saying yes started everything. From the gym, mall, pedicures, and minigolf to our first real talk that showed me communicating how we feel isn’t bad or scary, that month built the foundation for the happiness we share now. 💚',

    Memory:'September 2025 was our second month dating, and it’s when I started to feel like this could be something truly special. We talked more, opened up about everything, and you became someone I could trust with anything. Highlights included our Sedona trip, spending every weekend together, and realizing just how jacked your back was, lol. ❤️',

    Memory:'October 2025 was when we had our first big fight, and I couldn’t believe it happened the way it did. Looking back, I’m grateful we worked through it because it made me realize how much I care about you and how much I want you in my life. You make everything easier. Some highlights this month were our Los Angeles trip and spending Halloween together.💜',

    Memory:'November 2025 — I’m writing this early in the month, but I already know it’s going to be something special. My favorite memory we’ve ever shared happened this month: the night we played pool and stayed up talking for hours. It made me so happy and made me feel incredibly close to you, like I could talk to you about anything.🤍',
